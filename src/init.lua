 	Style Guide:

	- PascalCase: Property, Method, Class, Paths
	- camelCase: Function, Variable, Instance, Module
	- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE: Constant
	- _privateCase: Internal

	- A property/method is any variable linked specifically to an instance of a class
	- A static value in a class is NOT a property/method, but rather a variable/function
	- A variable/function is any value not specifically linked to an instance of a class
	- A constant is a value that never changes, such as an error message or digits of pi
	- A variable using _privateCase should never be used and is hidden from intellisense
 
	Originally, this module was meant to require every descendant, but Luau's typechecker
	seems to have a hard limit on type descriptors and considers the module "too complex"

	As an alternative, I've decided to use it to guarantee every module has loaded until the
	typechecker is more robust
